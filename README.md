# AmbientCGImporter
Import textures directly from [AmbientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) into Unity as quickly as possible. Automatically converts files to correct format for Unity and generates a material for it.

# Installation
You can find the latest version as a Unity package in the [release tab](https://github.com/agroth01/AmbientCGImporter/releases/tag/Unity). Then just drag the .unitypackage file into your project and follow the wizard.

# Usage
You can access the tool through the menubar at "Tools/AmbientCG Importer". From here you need to paste the url for the texture you want. Example: `https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Rock050`. Then chose the desired texture resolution to download and press import! Once finished, your material will be located in the AmbientCGImporter folder.

# Contributions
The tool is very rough and could probably be improved upon and optimized. If you want to help, feel free to create a pull request.

# Credits
The original code for extracting and converting the textures into Unity format is taken from [this](https://forum.unity.com/threads/free-ambientcg-to-unity-texture-converter-1500-free-pbr-materials.1219455/) post. The creator deserves most of the credit, as this is based on his/her work!  
  Also a big thank you to the developer of AmbientCG for such an amazing service. Definitely a great resource for any gamedev!
